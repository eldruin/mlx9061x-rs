## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2024-05-21

### Changed

- [breaking-change] Transitioned `embedded-hal` to version 1.0
- Add feature `defmt-03` to derive "`defmt::Format`" from `defmt = "0.3"` for public types.

## [0.2.1] - 2023-06-02

### Added

- Methods for reading temperature as a integer (`u16`).
  Users are advised to ONLY use these methods if running into to trouble using
  the standard temperature reading methods returning `f32` values as it's a more accurate read.

## [0.2.0] - 2021-05-22

### Added

- Add support for device sleep and wake.

### Changed

- Removed delays after final EEPROM writes before exiting a method.
  Users are advised to wait enough time before interacting with the device again.
  Thanks to @David-OConnor for the suggestion.
